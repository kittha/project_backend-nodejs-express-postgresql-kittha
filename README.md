# Questions and Answers API

This API provides endpoints to manage questions and answers, allowing users to create, retrieve, update, and delete questions, as well as interact with answers by upvoting or downvoting.

## Technologies Used

This backend project is built using Node.js and Express for robust server-side JavaScript development. Here's why these technologies were chosen:

- Node.js: Chosen for its asynchronous and event-driven architecture, ideal for handling multiple concurrent requests efficiently.
- Express: Selected for its minimalistic yet powerful framework that simplifies routing, middleware management, and handling HTTP requests.
- Rate Limiting Middleware: Custom rate limiting middleware is implemented to mitigate abuse and ensure fair usage of the API.
- PostgreSQL: Used as the relational database to store questions, answers, and user data, ensuring data integrity and scalability.
- Swagger: Integrated for API documentation, providing clear and interactive documentation for developers consuming the API.
